target:
    A single product of a builder (a builder may have more than one target).
    Usually a file but may not be so (may be a blob on s3 or something)
    a target has a name.
    Examples:
        file://foo.txt
        s3://bucket/path
        ...
    You can build a target if you know it's name.
    Targets do not expose themselves as object to the users.


Builder: a piece of code that builds.
    It receives multiple targets as inputs (often one) and produces multiple targets (often one)
    Builders have a type but do not have a name.
    If you want to run a specific builder then you can run it with a reference.
